# nier-weapons-tracker
A react project to help the user track which weapons they've collected in NieR Gestalt/Replicant, and to display the items necessary to upgrade them fully

Made for mobile view, because that's the only way I plan to use it. I should probably learn Android development and just make myself an app next....
