# nier-weapons-tracker
A react project to help the user track which weapons they've collected in NieR Gestalt/Replicant, and to display the items necessary to upgrade them fully

Doesn't actually update yet. The checkboxes won't update any data. Next step is to connect to Redux, and possibly use Redux-thunk to keep the state?
Only made to display on my phone right now.
